      application(s), for troubleshooting, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.<br>
      All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete, and accurate, and<br>

      Information automatically collected<br>
      In Short: Some information &mdash; such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or browser<br>

      GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your current location<br>
      (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either<br>
      by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location setting on your device.<br>
      However, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the<br>
      Services.<br>
      2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?<br>
      In Short: We process your information to provide, improve, and administer our Services,<br>
      communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. We may<br>

      provide you with the requested service.<br>
      To save or protect an individual's vital interest. We may process your information when<br>
      necessary to save or protect an individual&rsquo;s vital interest, such as to prevent harm.<br>
      3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?<br>
      In Short: We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we<br>
      have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your<br>
      consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our<br>
      contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.<br>
      If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.<br>
      The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the<br>
      valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may<br>
      rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:<br>
      Consent. We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to<br>
      use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any<br>
      time. Learn more about withdrawing your consent.<br>
      Performance of a Contract. We may process your personal information when we believe it is<br>
      necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at<br>
      your request prior to entering into a contract with you.<br>
      Legal Obligations. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for<br>
      compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or<br>
      regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as<br>
      evidence in litigation in which we are involved.<br>
      Vital Interests. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect<br>
      your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential<br>
      threats to the safety of any person.<br>
      If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.<br>
      We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express<br>
      consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your<br>
      permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any<br>
      time.<br>
      In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process<br>
      your information without your consent, including, for example:<br>
      If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a<br>
      timely way<br>
      For investigations and fraud detection and prevention<br>
      For business transactions provided certain conditions are met<br>
      If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or<br>
      settle an insurance claim<br>
      For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin<br>
      If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of<br>
      financial abuse<br>
      If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the<br>
      availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes<br>
      related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada<br>
      or a province<br>
      If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court<br>
      relating to the production of records<br>
      If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession<br>
      and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced<br>
      If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes<br>
      If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations<br>
      4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?<br>
      In Short: We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with<br>
      the following third parties.<br>
      Vendors, Consultants, and Other Third-Party Service Providers. We may share your data<br>

      work. We have contracts in place with our third parties, which are designed to help<br>
      safeguard your personal information. This means that they cannot do anything with your<br>
      personal information unless we have instructed them to do it. They will also not share your<br>
      personal information with any organization apart from us. They also commit to protect the<br>
      data they hold on our behalf and to retain it for the period we instruct. The third parties we<br>
      may share personal information with are as follows:<br>

      Offer Wall. Our application(s) may display a third-party hosted &quot;offer wall.&quot; Such an offer wall<br>
      allows third-party advertisers to offer virtual currency, gifts, or other items to users in return<br>
      for the acceptance and completion of an advertisement offer. Such an offer wall may appear<br>
      in our application(s) and be displayed to you based on certain data, such as your geographic<br>
      area or demographic information. When you click on an offer wall, you will be brought to an<br>
      external website belonging to other persons and will leave our application(s). A unique<br>
      identifier, such as your user ID, will be shared with the offer wall provider in order to prevent<br>
      fraud and properly credit your account with the relevant reward.<br>
      5. WHAT IS OUR STANCE ON THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES?<br>
      In Short: We are not responsible for the safety of any information that you share with third<br>
      parties that we may link to or who advertise on our Services, but are not affiliated with, our<br>
      Services.<br>
      The Services, including our offer wall, may link to third-party websites, online services, or<br>
      mobile applications and/or contain advertisements from third parties that are not affiliated<br>
      with us and which may link to other websites, services, or applications. Accordingly, we do<br>
      not make any guarantee regarding any such third parties, and we will not be liable for any<br>
      loss or damage caused by the use of such third-party websites, services, or applications.<br>
      The inclusion of a link towards a third-party website, service, or application does not imply an<br>
      endorsement by us. We cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of data you provide to any<br>
      third parties. Any data collected by third parties is not covered by this privacy notice. We are<br>
      not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of any third<br>
      parties, including other websites, services, or applications that may be linked to or from the<br>
      Services. You should review the policies of such third parties and contact them directly to<br>
      respond to your questions.<br>
      6. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?<br>
      In Short: If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a social media account, we<br>
      may have access to certain information about you.<br>
      Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media<br>
      account details (like your Facebook or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we will<br>
      receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile<br>
      information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will<br>
      often include your name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well as other<br>
      information you choose to make public on such a social media platform.<br>
      We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this<br>
      privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note<br>
      that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information<br>
      by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice<br>
      to understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information, and how you can<br>
      set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.<br>
      7. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?<br>
      In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in<br>
      this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.<br>
      We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes<br>
      set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law<br>
      (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require<br>
      us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have<br>
      an account with us.<br>
      When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information,<br>
      we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example,<br>
      because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will<br>
      securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until<br>
      deletion is possible.<br>
      8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?<br>
      In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and<br>
      technical security measures.<br>
      We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security<br>
      measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However,<br>
      despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission<br>
      over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure,<br>
      so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third<br>
      parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify<br>
      your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information,<br>
      transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should<br>
      only access the Services within a secure environment.<br>
      9. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?<br>
      In Short: In some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom<br>
      (UK), Switzerland, and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control<br>
      over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any<br>
      time.<br>
      In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have certain rights under<br>
      applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain<br>
      a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the<br>
      processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and (v) not to be<br>
      subject to automated decision-making. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right<br>
      to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by<br>
      contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section &quot;HOW CAN YOU<br>
      CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?&quot; below.<br>
      We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection<br>
      laws.<br>
      If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your<br>
      personal information, you also have the right to complain to your Member State data<br>
      protection authority or UK data protection authority.<br>
      If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the Federal Data Protection and<br>
      Information Commissioner.<br>
      Withdrawing your consent: If we are relying on your consent to process your personal<br>
      information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law,<br>
      you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at<br>
      any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section &quot;HOW CAN<br>
      YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?&quot; below or updating your preferences.<br>
      However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its<br>
      withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal<br>
      information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.<br>
      Account Information<br>
      If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate<br>
      your account, you can:<br>
      Log in to your account settings and update your user account.<br>
      Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and<br>
      information from our active databases. However, we may retain some information in our files<br>
      to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our legal<br>
      terms and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.<br>
      If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at<br>
      harryecran@gmail.com.<br>
      10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES<br>
      Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a<br>
      Do-Not-Track (&quot;DNT&quot;) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference<br>
      not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage<br>
      no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been<br>
      finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other<br>
      mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a<br>
      standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you<br>
      about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.<br>
